          Welcome to My Portfolio Hello and welcome to my cumulative Portfolio
          for Eng 131 Fall Quarter 2012! My name is Anthony Evans and I am
          making this portfolio not only to display the works that I have
          written in this class, but also to show how my writing has improved
          throughout the quarter. At the beginning of this course I was not the
          most confident in my writing skills, in fact I always dreaded having
          to write essays. I made it a goal to become a better writer and find a
          writing style that worked for me instead of relying on the writing
          models given to me in High School. I am making this portfolio in order
          to show that I have finally reached my goals, and have grown in to a
          much more confident writer than I was before. Compared to the
          beginning of this quarter where I was always questioning my writing
          while taking hours upon hours to write a short assignment, I am now
          much more confident in my writing and feel that I have undoubtedly
          improved in my writing. In the beginning of this course I was
          constantly taking too much time to write my introductory paragraphs,
          and always over-thought my papers, changing my sentences multiple
          times before I decided it was good enough. However, as the year
          progressed I noticed that I was spending less time wondering if my
          sentences or paragraphs were perfect and instead just wrote what first
          came into my head, worrying about the revisions later. Not only have I
          improved in my efficiency of writing essays, but I have also improved
          in my writing in general as evident within my each of my essays.
          Overall, I would say that my writing has drastically improved since
          the beginning of the quarter. My essays are now not only more
          organized than they were at the beginning of the year, but they also
          flow better, and are much stronger in general. By trying out different
          writing styles throughout the year, I was finally able to find the
          writing style that fit me the best and can finally say that I am
          comfortable with my writing. Through this portfolio I hope to prove
          that I have in fact become a better and more efficient writer than I
          was before. My goals in this course were to find a writing style of my
          own, become a better writer in general, and most of all to
          significantly cut down the time it took me to write essays, meaning
          that I needed to stop over-thinking everything. By displaying both my
          good works and my bad works I hope to show everyone how much I have
          improved within the past few months, and prove that I have in fact met
          my goals that I had set for myself this quarter.
